## Getting Started

This project is extremely easy to use!

Clone the repository, change the values in the HTML document as you see fit, and then open the document in a browser and Select All/Copy the content.

You can then paste this into Gmail, Apple Mail, or any other HTML-based email signature editor.

### Customization

If you would like a custom headshot, find a hosting platform for the images like Google Drive or Dropbox and make them public, then link out to that image.

This can also be done to change the fonts using Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts.
